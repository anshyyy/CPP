{"title":"B. Shifting Sort","contestId":"1579","problemIndex":"B","timeLimit":"2 seconds","memLimit":"256 megabytes","inputFormat":"standard input","outputFormat":"standard output","problemHtml":"<p>The new generation external memory contains an array of integers $$$a[1 \\ldots n] = [a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n]$$$.</p><p>This type of memory does not support changing the value of an arbitrary element. Instead, it allows you to cut out any segment of the given array, <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">cyclically shift</span> (rotate) it by any offset and insert it back into the same place.</p><p>Technically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions: </p><ol> <li> You may select arbitrary indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l &lt; r \\le n$$$) as the boundaries of the segment. </li><li> Then you replace the segment $$$a[l \\ldots r]$$$ with it&apos;s <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">cyclic shift</span> to the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">left</span> by an arbitrary offset $$$d$$$. The concept of a <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">cyclic shift</span> can be also explained by following relations: the sequence $$$[1, 4, 1, 3]$$$ is a cyclic shift of the sequence $$$[3, 1, 4, 1]$$$ to the left by the offset $$$1$$$ and the sequence $$$[4, 1, 3, 1]$$$ is a cyclic shift of the sequence $$$[3, 1, 4, 1]$$$ to the left by the offset $$$2$$$. </li></ol><p>For example, if $$$a = [1, \\color{blue}{3, 2, 8}, 5]$$$, then choosing $$$l = 2$$$, $$$r = 4$$$ and $$$d = 2$$$ yields a segment $$$a[2 \\ldots 4] = [3, 2, 8]$$$. This segment is then shifted by the offset $$$d = 2$$$ to the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">left</span>, and you get a segment $$$[8, 3, 2]$$$ which then takes the place of of the original elements of the segment. In the end you get $$$a = [1, \\color{blue}{8, 3, 2}, 5]$$$.</p><p>Sort the given array $$$a$$$ using no more than $$$n$$$ cyclic shifts of any of its segments. Note that you don&apos;t need to minimize the number of cyclic shifts. Any method that requires $$$n$$$ or less cyclic shifts will be accepted.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$)&#xA0;&#x2014; the number of test cases.</p><p>The next $$$2t$$$ lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. </p><p>The first line of each test case description contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 50$$$)&#xA0;&#x2014; the length of the array. The second line consists of space-separated elements of the array $$$a_i$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$).

Please remember that only the cyclic shifts <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">to the left</span> are considered so the chosen segment will be shifted by the offset $$$d$$$ to the <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">to the left</span>.</p><p>Note that you are not required to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed for sorting.
